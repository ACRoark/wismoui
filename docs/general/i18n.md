# Internationalization

The solution uses the `react-intl` library to manage internationalization (i18n) support including multi-language support for both static text, number, date and currency formats, etc. The complement react-intl docs can be found here:

    https://github.com/yahoo/react-intl/wiki

The (default) English language text for messages are defined in the `messages.ts` file associated with each component. Text for other languages are defined in translation files located in the [app/translations](https://github.com/VetsFirstChoice/evolution-ui/tree/master/app/translations) folder.

> NOTE: An error will be written to the console when the application is
> unable to find the translation for a given message in the current
> language. When this occurs, the default (English) value will be
> rendered.

## Extracting i18n JSON files

You can extract all messages within each component that require translating by running the following command:

```
  npm run extract-intl
```

This will extract all messages into JSON translation files located in the [app/translations](https://github.com/TBD/wismo-ui/tree/master/app/translations) folder corresponding to each language defined in the [app/i18n.js](https://github.com/TBD/wismo-ui/blob/master/app/i18n.js) file.

> NOTE: You can manually add items to the translation files, but running
> the script ensures you don't miss any.

## Adding a Language

You can add a language by running the generate command:

```
  npm run generate language
```

When prompted, enter the two character ISO 639-1 standard language code (e.g. "fr", "de", "es" - without quotes). The full list of language codes can be found here: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes)

The [app/i18n.js](https://github.com/DTE/evolution-ui/blob/master/app/i18n.js) file will be updated to include the new language and a new JSON language file named `{code}.json` (where `{code}` is the language code you entered above) is created in the [app/translations](https://github.com/TBD/evolution-ui/tree/master/app/translations) folder with every message found in the application (see the previous topic). All messages will be set to the default value specified in the messages file with the language code appended.

> Note: It is up to you to replace the default values with the actual
> translations for the language.
