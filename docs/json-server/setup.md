# Setup

## Installation

Make sure you have the server folder within the root of the project. This is where all the files for setting up the data and running the json-server are stored.

## Command Line 

1. From the root of the project folder `cd server` then run `npm install`.
2. Once installation has finished, `npm run json-server`.

## Note

Whenever you change the data to the json-server, you need to close the server and re-run it.
